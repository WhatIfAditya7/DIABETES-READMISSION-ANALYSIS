# Problem Statement <br>
Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health challenge, impacting individuals across the world. Individuals with all age groups, including an alarming rise among younger populations. While it is prevalent in people aged 30 to 50. Talking about specific races, it also disproportionately affects certain demographics, with many Caucasian and African American individuals facing significant challenges in managing the condition. With millions of patients requiring complex care, numerous medications and therapies are prescribed to control diabetes and prevent complications and then people are admitted again to the hospital within 30 days or after period. This study investigates the effectiveness of these treatments in managing diabetes and explores the factors associated with hospital readmissions within 30 days. Utilizing a dataset of 100,000 patient records, the analysis considered 50 key attributes, including demographics, medical diagnoses, medications, and hospital-related details. The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. <br>
